# html-webpack-inject-assets-plugin
A simple webpack plugin using html-webpack-plugin's hook to inject assets.

Installation
------------
Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
$ npm install --save-dev html-webpack-inject-assets-plugin
```

Basic Usage
-----------
Require the plugin in your webpack config:

```javascript
var HtmlWebpackInjectAssetsPlugin = require('html-webpack-inject-assets-plugin');
```

Add the plugin to your webpack config as follows:

```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({inject: false}),
  new HtmlWebpackInjectAssetsPlugin()
]
```
The above configuration will try to find the slots(default to `!%css slot%!` and `!%js slot%!`) in the html generated by html-webpack-plugin, and replace them with the assets on present.
